<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tequila Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>100% Tequila</li><li>Mixto Tequila</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tequila market is primarily divided into two types: 100% agave tequila and mixto tequila. 100% agave tequila is crafted entirely from the blue agave plant, ensuring higher quality, flavor, and authenticity.
