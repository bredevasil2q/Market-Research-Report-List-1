<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rear Wheel Steering Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Steering</li><li>Active Steering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rear-wheel steering market consists of two primary types: passive steering and active steering. Passive steering systems allow the rear wheels to turn slightly in relation to the front wheels, enhancing stability and maneuverability at low speeds. In contrast, active steering systems utilize electronic controls to adjust rear-wheel angles dynamically based on driving conditions, providing improved handling and responsiveness at various speeds. Both types aim to enhance vehicle performance, agility, and safety while improving the overall driving experience.</p></p>
