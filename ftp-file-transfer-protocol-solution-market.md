<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active mode</li><li>Passive mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The FTP solution market consists of two primary modes: active and passive. In active mode, the client opens a port and listens for the server to connect, which can lead to firewall complications. Conversely, passive mode simplifies connections by having the server open a random port for the client to connect, mitigating firewall issues and enhancing security. Businesses choose between these modes based on their network configurations and security requirements, optimizing file transfers and improving access to remote servers.</p></p>
